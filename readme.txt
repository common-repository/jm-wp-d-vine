Easy integration of Vine in posts !

== Description ==

Let's integrate some vine in WordPress posts.

**Disclaimer** : on no account this plugin could be associated with Vine by Vine Labs, Inc. I recommand you to use their mobile ( iOS and Android) application. 

The purpose of this plugin is not to provide full customization for embed. The embed service by Vine is really fine. 
You just have to click on the embed icon on vine.co and you'll get your embed code.

WP D-Vine allows you to embed quickly your video just by inserting URL of vine video. It works by adding a button in visual editor, full WYSIWYG.
